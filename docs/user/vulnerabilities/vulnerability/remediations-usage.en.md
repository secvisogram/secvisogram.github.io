# Remediations - Usage

All information on how to fix the vulnerability, or even if no fix is possible.

For End of Life products, typically, the category `no_fix_planned` is used.

If no patch or other remediation is available yet, this should be communicated via `none_available`.
It should then be described why this is the case.
