# Threats - Usage

Lists existing or possible threats like known exploits.

If a product is not affected an impact statement (threat with category `impact`) should be listed explaining the reason.

The threats should contain information about a vulnerability that is particularly exploited in a specific geographic area or industry (e.g. banks).

As the listed threats contains information that may change over time it should be assumed that the information is/was up-to-date at the time of writing.
