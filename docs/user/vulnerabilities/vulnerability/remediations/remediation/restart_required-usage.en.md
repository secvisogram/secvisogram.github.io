# Restart Required - Usage

Specifies whether a restart is required for the mitigation measure, and if so, in what scope.

This is relevant as in some cases where connections exist the scope may be beyond a single machine.

This information may help in making better / risk-based decisions.
A remediation with `restart_required/category` `none` may be applied faster than another one.
The information is also especially relevant if the product itself is modified with the mitigating measure (workaround, mitigation, or vendor fix).

If the product environment is modified (e.g., adjusting the rules of an external firewall), it is difficult if not impossible for vendors to determine if a restart is required.
