**Category - Usage**

The category indicates to which type the remediation belongs.

For end of life products the category `no_fix_planned` is common. A reference to the fact that these are end of life products is sufficient.
It is best to include the date since when these products are no longer supported. A reference to compatible successor products is permissible and recommended.
In other cases where `no_fix_planned` is used, it should be stated why no fix has been created or is planned.
Permissible reasons include that the hardware requirements of the mitigation measure exceed the capabilities of the existing hardware.

*Example:*

* An embedded system uses 1024 RSA keys when RSA 3072 keys would be secure but there is not enough memory to execute the computations.

The value `none_available` must always be specified if no remediation is available.
Can also be specified if no patch is available yet, but it is planned. In this case an expected release date of the patch should be specified.
Once the patch is available, a remediation with the category `vendor_fix` will replace this remediation.

Unless otherwise specified, the category `vendor_fix` assumes that the patch fully remediates the vulnerability.
If there are any effects on functionality, these must be entered in the details of the remediation.
Additionally, installation instructions or prerequisites can also be specified.

For the value `mitigation` it is crucial that the exploitability is reduced, but the vulnerability is not completely fixed.

A `workaround` describes a configuration or special deployment that can be used to prevent the exploitability of the vulnerability.

Hotfixes are usually classified as `workarounds` because they prevent exploitability.
However, hotfixes can also be classified as `mitigation` if they do not completely fix the vulnerability.
Hotfixes can also be listed at `vendor_fix` if they completely fix the problem.
