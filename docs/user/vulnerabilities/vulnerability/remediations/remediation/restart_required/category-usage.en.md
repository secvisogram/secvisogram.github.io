**Category - Usage**

Specifies the type and scope of the required restart in machine-readable form.

Mitigation measures that do not require a restart and can therefore be executed during operation may be preferred.

* `none`: No restart is necessary.

  Example: "kill telnet process".

* `vulnerable_component`: Only the affected product needs to be restarted.

  Example: natepad++ portable, exit, install new version or patch, and restart.

* `service`: Services need to be restarted.

  Example: `CVE 2019-11043` remote code execution in a configuration of nginx and fpn. Service must be restarted when running nextcloud in default configuration.

* `parent`: Is always the case when the vulnerability is in a product running in a child process. If only the child program is restarted, the parent program does not know that a new binary exists.

* `dependencies`: The vulnerability in the program in the parent process and all programs depending on it must be restarted.

  Example: pppd

* `connected`: All products connected to the affected product, as well as the affected product itself, must be restarted. The connection can be via network or other inter-process communication.

  Example: A product that uses TLS only at the beginning and does not do session renegotiation.

* `machine`: The entire machine must be rebooted.

  Example: Windows 10 Semiannual Upgrade.

* `zone`: A zone consisting of multiple machines (e.g. security zone or broadcast zone) must be restarted.

  Example: WannaCry infecting industrial PCs which have the Write Filter enabled. Windows reboots after infection when WannaCry tries to encrypt the disk which removes WannaCry from this PC.
  However, other PCs in the same security zone still have WannaCry and reinfect each other. To get a clean zone, all equipment must be turned off and be rebooted afterwards.

* `system`: A system usually consisting of multiple zones must be restarted.

  Example: Update to a new (encrypted) version of an industry protocol.
