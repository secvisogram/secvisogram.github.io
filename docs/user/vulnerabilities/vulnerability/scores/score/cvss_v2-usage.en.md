**Cvss V2 - Usage**

The schema at [https://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-v2.0.json](https://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-v2.0.json) must be adhered to.

The computed values must be correct according to their definition. For this computation, the `vectorString` takes precedence over the other properties.

The given properties must not contradict the CVSS vector.

If the corresponding product is listed in `/vulnerabilities[]/product_status/first_fixed[]` or `/vulnerabilities[]/product_status/fixed[]`, the `environmental_score` should be `0`.

The `exploitability` should be given to convey at least if the vulnerability is already actively exploited.

The single fields are encoded in the vector string and thus may be redundant.
However, adding them is encouraged as the vector string may be incomplete.

Using CVSS v3.1 is encouraged.
