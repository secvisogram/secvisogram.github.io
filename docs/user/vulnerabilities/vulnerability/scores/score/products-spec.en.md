# Products - Specification

Product IDs (`products`) of value type `products_t` with 1 or more items indicates for which products the given scores apply.
A score object SHOULD reflect the associated product's status (for example, a fixed product no longer contains a vulnerability and should have a CVSS score of 0, or simply no score listed; the known affected versions of that product can list the vulnerability score as it applies to them).
