For CVSS scores, the referenced schema must be adhered to.

For CVSS scores, the computed values must be correct according to their definition. For this computation, the `vectorString` takes precedence over the other properties.

For CVSS scores, the given properties must not contradict the CVSS vector.

CVSS v2 (`cvss_v2`) should not be the only scoring item used.
