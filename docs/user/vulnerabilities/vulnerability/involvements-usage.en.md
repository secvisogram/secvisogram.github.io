# Involvements - Usage

The list of involvements must not contain the same `party` regardless of its `status` more than once at any `date`.

Can be used to document the disclosure timeline.
Who contacted whom and when, who learned about the vulnerability and what actions were taken.

Should be used especially if the vendor did not respond to the contact attempts or denies the existence of the vulnerability or the CVD process failed.
