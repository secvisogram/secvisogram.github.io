# CWE - Usage

CWE is a community-developed list of software and hardware weakness types.
It serves as a common language, a measuring stick for security tools, and as a baseline for weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts.
(Cited from [cwe.mitre.org](https://cwe.mitre.org/))

The Vulnerability classification of CWE helps assess groups of vulnerabilities.

The CWE that most accurately identifies the vulnerability should be chosen and the given CWE must exist and be valid.

A link to the used CWE should be provided in the vulnerability's references.
