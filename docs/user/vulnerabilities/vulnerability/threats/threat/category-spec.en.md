# Category - Specification

Category of the threat (`category`) of value type `string` and `enum` categorizes the threat according to the rules of the specification.
Valid values are:

* `exploit_status`
* `impact`
* `target_set`

The value `exploit_status` indicates that the `details` field contains a description of the degree to which an exploit for the vulnerability is known.
This knowledge can range from information privately held among a very small group to an issue that has been described to the public at a major conference or is being widely exploited globally.
For consistency and simplicity, this section can be a mirror image of the CVSS "Exploitability" metric.
However, it can also contain a more contextual status, such as "Weaponized" or "Functioning Code".

The value `impact` indicates that the `details` field contains an assessment of the impact on the user or the target set if the vulnerability is successfully exploited or a description why it cannot be exploited.
If applicable, for consistency and simplicity, this section can be a textual summary of the three CVSS impact metrics.
These metrics measure how a vulnerability detracts from the three core security properties of an information system: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

The value `target_set` indicates that the `details` field contains a description of the currently known victim population in whatever terms are appropriate.
Such terms MAY include: operating system platform, types of products, user segments, and geographic distribution.
