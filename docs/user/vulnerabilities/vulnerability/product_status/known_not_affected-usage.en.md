**Known Not Affected - Usage**

Lists only non-affected products.

Products that are only not affected in a certain configuration must not be listed here.
These products are considered affected as the user has to check the configuration (which is a remediation and can be described as action statement).

It should always be stated why the products are not affected.

A product listed here must not be listed in any of the following

* `product_status/first_affected[]`
* `product_status/known_affected[]`
* `product_status/last_affected[]`
* `product_status/first_fixed[]`
* `product_status/fixed[]`
* `product_status/under_investigation[]`

For each entry a corresponding `full_product_name` element with matching `product_id` must be defined.

For the `csaf_vex` profile, for each item in `known_not_affected` a corresponding impact statement must exist in `/vulnerabilities[]/flags` or `vulnerabilities[]/threats`.
For the latter one, the `category` value for such a statement must be `impact`

Further description of this type can be found under [types](types/products-usage.en.md).

_Additional for profile CSAF VEX_

For the `csaf_vex` profile, for each item in `known_not_affected` a corresponding impact statement must exist in `/vulnerabilities[]/flags` or `vulnerabilities[]/threats`.
For the latter one, the `category` value for such a statement must be `impact` and the `details` field SHALL contain a description why the vulnerability cannot be exploited.
