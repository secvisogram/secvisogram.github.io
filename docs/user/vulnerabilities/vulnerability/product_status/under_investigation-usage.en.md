**Under Investigation - Usage**

For the products listed here, it is not yet clear whether they are affected or not affected.
It is expected that in a later release the analysis result will be communicated.

If general mitigation guidance can be provided and is applicable to products currently under investigation, it should be provided.
A valid remediation can also be of the category `none_available` or `no_fix_planned`.

Especially useful in cases of large Multi-Party Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure to provide the current status of the investigation.

A product listed here must not be listed in any of the following

* `product_status/first_affected[]`
* `product_status/known_affected[]`
* `product_status/last_affected[]`
* `product_status/known_not_affected[]`
* `product_status/first_fixed[]`
* `product_status/fixed[]`

For each entry a corresponding `full_product_name` element with matching `product_id` must be defined.

Further description of this type can be found under [types](types/products-usage.en.md).
