**Recommended - Usage**

If there are multiple fixes available, it is recommended to list the preferred one here.

If there is no fixed version, but several vulnerable ones where the characteristics of the vulnerability differs, the field can also be used to recommend less vulnerable versions.

If a patch fixes one vulnerability but introduces another, it is necessary to weigh which of the vulnerabilities is more acceptable and recommend the less vulnerable version accordingly.

Whenever a vulnerable version is specified as recommended, a textual description under `/vulnerabilities[]/notes` must indicate why it was recommended.

For each entry a corresponding `full_product_name` element with matching `product_id` must be defined.

Further description of this type can be found under [types](types/products-usage.en.md).
