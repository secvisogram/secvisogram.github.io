**Known Affected - Usage**

Listing affected products facilitates the examination if products are affected.

A product listed here must not be listed in any of the following

* `product_status/known_not_affected[]`
* `product_status/first_fixed[]`
* `product_status/fixed[]`
* `product_status/under_investigation[]`

For each product ID listed here, a remediation should exist.

For each product ID listed here, a score object which covers the product should exist.

For all profiles other than `csaf_vex`, an action statement should be listed in the remediations - also for products for which there is no (planned) fix.

For each entry a corresponding `full_product_name` element with matching `product_id` must be defined.

For the `csaf_vex` profile, for each item in `known_affected` a corresponding action statement in `/vulnerabilities[]/remediations` must exist.

Further description of this type can be found under [types](types/products-usage.en.md).

_Additional for profile CSAF VEX_

For the `csaf_vex` profile, for each item in `known_affected` a corresponding action statement in `/vulnerabilities[]/remediations` must exist.

The action statement describes what a user should do.
Optional, additional information MAY also be provided through `/vulnerabilities[]/notes` and `/vulnerabilities[]/threats`.
