# Flag - Specification

Every Flag item of value type `object` with the mandatory property

* [Label](vulnerabilities/vulnerability/flags/flag/label-spec.en.md) (`label`)

contains product specific information in regard to this vulnerability as a single machine readable flag.
For example, this could be a machine readable justification code why a product is not affected.
At least one of the optional elements Group IDs (`group_ids`) and Product IDs (`product_ids`) MUST be present to state for which products or product groups this flag is applicable.

> These flags enable the receiving party to automate the selection of actions to take.

In addition, any Flag item MAY provide the three optional properties

* [Date](vulnerabilities/vulnerability/flags/flag/date-spec.en.md) (`date`)
* [Group IDs](vulnerabilities/vulnerability/flags/flag/group_ids-spec.en.md) (`group_ids`)
* [Product IDs](vulnerabilities/vulnerability/flags/flag/product_ids-spec.en.md) (`product_ids`)
