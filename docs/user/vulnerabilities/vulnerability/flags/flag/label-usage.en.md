**Label - Usage**

Describes the most appropriate reason why the vulnerability is not exploitable in machine-readable form.

If there is no machine-readable status justification available that fits the reason, the impact statement must be done through an element in `/vulnerabilities[]/threats` with category `impact` and the description in `details`.
