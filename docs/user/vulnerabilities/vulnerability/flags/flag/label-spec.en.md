# Label - Specification

Label of the flag (`label`) of value type `string` and `enum` specifies the machine readable label. Valid `enum` values are:

* `component_not_present`
* `inline_mitigations_already_exist`
* `vulnerable_code_cannot_be_controlled_by_adversary`
* `vulnerable_code_not_in_execute_path`
* `vulnerable_code_not_present`

The given values reflect the VEX not affected justifications. See [[VEX-Justification]](#vex-justification) for more details. The values MUST be used as follows:

* `component_not_present`: The software is not affected because the vulnerable component is not in the product.
* `vulnerable_code_not_present`: The product is not affected because the code underlying the vulnerability is not present in the product.
  > Unlike `component_not_present`, the component in question is present, but for whatever reason (e.g. compiler
  > options) the specific code causing the vulnerability is not present in the component.
* `vulnerable_code_cannot_be_controlled_by_adversary`: The vulnerable component is present, and the component contains the vulnerable code.
   However, vulnerable code is used in such a way that an attacker cannot mount any anticipated attack.
* `vulnerable_code_not_in_execute_path`: The affected code is not reachable through the execution of the code, including non-anticipated states of the product.
  > Components that are neither used nor executed by the product.
* `inline_mitigations_already_exist`: Built-in inline controls or mitigations prevent an adversary from leveraging the vulnerability.
