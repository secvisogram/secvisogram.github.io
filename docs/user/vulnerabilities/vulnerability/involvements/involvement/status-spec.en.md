# Status - Specification

Party status (`status`) of value type `string` and `enum` defines contact status of the involved party.
Valid values are:

* `completed`
* `contact_attempted`
* `disputed`
* `in_progress`
* `not_contacted`
* `open`

Each status is mutually exclusive - only one status is valid for a particular vulnerability at a particular time.
As the vulnerability ages, a party's involvement could move from state to state.
However, in many cases, a document producer may choose not to issue CSAF documents at each state, or simply omit this element altogether.
It is recommended, however, that vendors that issue CSAF documents indicating an open or in-progress involvement SHOULD eventually expect to issue a document containing one of the statuses `disputed` or `completed` as the latest one.

> The two vulnerability involvement status states, `contact_attempted` and `not_contacted` are intended for use by
> document producers other than vendors (such as research or coordinating entities).

The value `completed` indicates that the party asserts that investigation of the vulnerability is complete.
No additional information, fixes, or documentation from the party about the vulnerability should be expected to be released.

The value `contact_attempted` indicates that the document producer attempted to contact the party.

The value `disputed` indicates that the party disputes the vulnerability report in its entirety.
This status SHOULD be used when the party believes that a vulnerability report regarding a product is completely inaccurate (that there is no real underlying security vulnerability) or that the technical issue being reported has no security implications.

The value `in_progress` indicates that some hotfixes, permanent fixes, mitigations, workarounds, or patches may have been made available by the party, but more information or fixes may be released in the future.
The use of this status by a vendor indicates that future information from the vendor about the vulnerability is to be expected.

The value `not_contacted` indicates that the document producer has not attempted to make contact with the party.

The value `open` is the default status.
It doesnâ€™t indicate anything about the vulnerability remediation effort other than the fact that the party has acknowledged awareness of the vulnerability report.
The use of this status by a vendor indicates that future updates from the vendor about the vulnerability are to be expected.
