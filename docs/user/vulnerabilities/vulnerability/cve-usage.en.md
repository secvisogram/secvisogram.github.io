**CVE - Usage**

CVE numbers help to identify the vulnerability and ensure the same terms are used.

The same CVE must not be repeated for multiple vulnerability items.

CVE numbers should also be assigned for vulnerabilities found internally.

CVE numbers can be requested from MITRE or another CNA (CVE Numbering Authority).
If organizations regularly publish vulnerabilities, they should consider becoming a CNA, as described [here](https://www.cve.org/PartnerInformation/Partner#HowToBecomeAPartner).
