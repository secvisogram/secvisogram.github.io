**Label - Usage**

The label should be set and must be valid. There are four traffic light values:

* `RED` - *Not for disclosure, restricted to participants only*:

  In the context of a meeting, for example, `TLP:RED` information is limited to those present at the meeting.
  The distribution of `TLP:RED` information will generally be via a defined list and in some circumstances may only be passed verbally or in person.

* `AMBER` - *Limited disclosure, restricted to participants’ organizations*:

  The recipient may share `TLP:AMBER` information with others within their organization, but only on a ‘need-to-know’ basis.
  The originator may be expected to specify the intended limits of that sharing.

* `GREEN` - *Limited disclosure, restricted to the community*:

  Information in this category can be circulated widely within a particular community.
  However, the information may not be published or posted publicly on the Internet, nor released outside the community.

* `WHITE` - *Disclosure is not limited*:

  Subject to standard copyright rules, `TLP:WHITE` information may be distributed freely, without restriction.
