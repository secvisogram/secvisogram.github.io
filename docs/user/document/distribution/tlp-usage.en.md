# TLP - Usage

The Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) is a standardized agreement for the exchange of information worthy of protection
(see [https://www.first.org/tlp/docs/tlp-v1.pdf](https://www.first.org/tlp/docs/tlp-v1.pdf)).

Public Advisories should generally be classified as `TLP:WHITE`.

If there are prior obligations to inform a closed user group, these should be distributed as `TLP:AMBER` or `TLP:RED`.

In principle, [the definition of FIRST](https://www.first.org/tlp/) applies.
If a different definition has been agreed with the customer group, this must be specified with a URL (`/document/distribution/tlp/url`).
