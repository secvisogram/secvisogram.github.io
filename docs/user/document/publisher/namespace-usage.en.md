**Namespace - Usage**

The namespace is useful to unambiguously and globally identify the vendor or manufacturer.

Often times a URL of the company or issuing party is used which is recommended.
Can also be a URL pointing to a page on which advisories are published.

In combination with the tracking ID (`/document/tracking/id`) the CSAF document is uniquely identifiable.
If the document version is added to that combination, a single version of the document is globally uniquely identified.
