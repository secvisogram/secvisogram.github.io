**Category - Usage**

The publisher's category is useful for the reader to understand the perspective of the publisher.
This information enables the consumer to estimate the trustworthiness of the advisory.

The valid values are

* `coordinator`
* `discoverer`
* `other`
* `translator`
* `user`
* `vendor`

In most cases the value `vendor` is correct.
If the value `translator` is used, the field `/document/source_lang` must be set.
