**Source Lang - Usage**

This field must be present and set if the value `translator` is used in `/document/publisher/categoy` to indicate the language of the original document.
If the document was not translated, this field should not be set.

The source language must not be the same as the document language in `/document/lang`.

Further description of this type can be found under [types](types/lang-usage.en.md).
