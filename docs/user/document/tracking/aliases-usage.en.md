# Aliases - Usage

Aliases can be used to indicate the number, identifier or name assigned to this advisory, case or issue by the coordinator, manufacturer, supplier or other party.
This can also include internal ticket numbers.

The aliases should not be used to list identifiers of single vulnerabilities which are listed in `/vulnerabilities[]/ids`.

*Examples:*

* `ICSA-20-168-01`
* `VU#257161`
* `Ripple20`
* `AMNESIA:33`
* `OT:ICEFALL`
