**Summary - Usage**

The summary aids the reader in initial assessment during inspection.

For the initial version a short notice indicating that this refers to this first version is sufficient,
e.g. "Initial version" or "Initial publication".

For all subsequent versions the difference to the last published version should be described as concrete as possible.

For pre-release versions, the changes are registered in the entry of the next version to be released.

*Example:*

For version 1.1.0-1 (draft for 1.1.0) the changes are registered in the entry for version 1.1.0.
