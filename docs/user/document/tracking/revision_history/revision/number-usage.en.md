**Number - Usage**

The document version of the document this revision history element corresponds to is used as value here.

The value must not be `0` or `0.y.z` if the document status (`/document/tracking/status`) is set to `final` or `interim`.

The value must not include pre-release information and should not include build metadata information.

Further description of this type can be found under [types](types/version-usage.en.md).
