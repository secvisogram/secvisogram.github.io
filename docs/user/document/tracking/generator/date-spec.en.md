# Date - Specification

Date of document generation (`date`) of value type `string` with format `date-time` SHOULD be the current date that the document was generated.
Because documents are often generated internally by a document producer and exist for a nonzero amount of time before being released, this field MAY be  different from the Initial Release Date and Current Release Date.
