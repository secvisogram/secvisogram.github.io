# Acknowledgments - Usage

Acknowledgments of people and organizations that were involved in discovery, publication and coordination of the process that lead to the CSAF document.

The acknowledgments are an important tool to reward and honor security researchers and contribute to the reputation of an organization.

In contrast to the Vulnerability Acknowledgments (`/vulnerabilities[]/acknowledgments`) contributions to the whole document can be honored.

Listing coordinating entities is recommended but not required.

Further description of this type can be found under [types](types/acknowledgments-usage.en.md).
