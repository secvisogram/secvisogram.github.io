# Generic URIs - Usage

Generic URIs are used to identify components within a SBOM (especially relevant for the VEX use case).
For CycloneDX and SPDX examples refer to [the specification](https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/cs02/csaf-v2.0-cs02.html#31338-full-product-name-type---product-identification-helper---generic-uris).

It can also be used for manufacturer-specific product identifiers not yet supported.
