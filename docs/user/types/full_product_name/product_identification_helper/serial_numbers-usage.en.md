# Serial Numbers - Usage

Serial numbers are particularly well suited for the identification of hardware.
Software installed on that hardware must be mapped via relationships (`/product_tree/relationships`).

Serial numbers are especially useful for end-of-life products, or if a series of product instances cannot be provided with an update due to production or technical characteristics.
