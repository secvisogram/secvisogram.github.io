# Category - Usage

The category of a reference should always be specified to be explicit.

`external`: links e.g. to a support article describing installation and update procedures, where descriptions of hotfixes can be found or to a description of restart procedures

`self`: links e.g. to exactly the same vulnerability in the human readable advisory

For vulnerabilities, usually the category refers to an `external` reference.
For the document references with category `self` are more common.

In the document references the canonical URL and reference of human-readable advisory must have category `self`.
All other references usually are `external`.
