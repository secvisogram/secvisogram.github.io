# Document - Usage

Contains all metadata that is required to identify the advisory.
This includes, among other things, the title and category (profile) of the document, as well as the publisher and version history.

A machine-readable advisory requires the same - or more - information than the human-readable version.
If more information is provided than in the human-readable format, this should be noted for the review of the document.
The human-readable advisory must be derivable from the machine-readable one. The machine-readable document is superordinated to the human-readable document.
